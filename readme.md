## Basic Blockchain Knowledge

### What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and oftentimes public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.

- [What is decentralization?](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/decentralization-in-blockchain/)
- [How does a blockchain work?](https://youtu.be/SSo_EIwHSd4)
- [What Is a Blockchain? | Blockchain Basics for Developers](https://youtu.be/4ff9esY_4aU)

### Decentralization

In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust that participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.

- [What is decentralization?](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/decentralization-in-blockchain/)
- [What is Decentralization in Blockchain?](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/what-is-decentralization-in-blockchain/)

### Why it matters

The nature of blockchain allows for trustless systems to be built on top of it. Users don’t rely on a centralized group of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons.

This decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.

- [Why is Blockchain Important and Why Does it Matter](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/blockchain-tutorial/why-is-blockchain-important)

### Blockchain Structure

The blockchain gets its name from its underlying structure. The blockchain is organized as a series of “blocks” that are “chained” together.

Understanding blockchain security requires understanding how the blockchain is put together. This requires knowing what the blocks and chains of blockchain are and why they are designed the way that they are.

### Mining and incentive models

Mining is the process of adding transaction details to the Blockchain, like sender address, hash value, etc. The Blockchain contains all the history of the transactions that have taken place in the past for record purposes and it is stored in such a manner that, it can’t be manipulated.

An Incentive is basically a reward given to a Blockchain Miner for speeding up the transactions and making correct decisions while processing the complete transaction securely.

### Testing

Testing smart contracts is one of the most important measures for improving smart contract security. Unlike traditional software, smart contracts cannot typically be updated after launching, making it imperative to test rigorously before deploying contracts onto mainnet.

- [Testing Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/testing/)
- [How to Test Ethereum Smart Contracts](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-test-ethereum-smart-contracts-35abc8fa199d)
- [Writing automated smart contract tests](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/writing-automated-tests)

#### Unit Tests

Unit testing involves testing individual components in a smart contract for correctness. A unit test is simple, quick to run, and provides a clear idea of what went wrong if the test fails.

- [Smart Contracts Unit Testing](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/testing/#unit-testing)
- [Tips for Unit Testing Ethereum Smart Contracts in Solidity](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-few-tips-for-unit-testing-ethereum-smart-contract-in-solidity-d804062068fb)

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests validate interactions between multiple components. For smart contract testing this can mean interactions between different components of a single contract, or across multiple contracts.

- [Unit tests vs integration tests | Smart contract testing course](https://youtu.be/GxnX9k8i0zM)

#### Code Coverage

Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand how much of your source is tested. It's a very useful metric that can help you assess the quality of your test suite.

- [Smart Contract Code Coverage In Hardhat](https://medium.com/coinmonks/smart-contract-code-coverage-in-hardhat-d4a5ff6c9ba6)

### Deployment

Unlike other software, smart contracts don’t run on a local computer or a remote server: they live on the blockchain. Thus, interacting with them is different from more traditional applications.

- [Deploying Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/deploying/)
- [Deploying and interacting with smart contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/deploying-and-interacting)

### Monitoring

Monitoring smart contracts allow their authors to view its activity and interactions based on generated transactions and events, allowing verification of the contract's intended purpose and functionality.

- [Monitoring Smart Contracts](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/event-monitoring/)

### Upgrades

Smart contracts are immutable by default. Once they are created there is no way to alter them, effectively acting as an unbreakable contract among participants. However, for some scenarios, it is desirable to be able to modify them.

## Security

Smart contracts are extremely flexible, capable of both holding large quantities of tokens (often in excess of $1B) and running immutable logic based on previously deployed smart contract code. While this has created a vibrant and creative ecosystem of trustless, interconnected smart contracts, it is also the perfect ecosystem to attract attackers looking to profit by exploiting vulnerabilities

- [Smart Contract Security](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/security/)
- [Ethereum Smart Contract Security Recommendations](https://consensys.net/blog/developers/ethereum-smart-contract-security-recommendations/)

### Practices

Smart contract programming requires a different engineering mindset. The cost of failure can be high, and change can be difficult.

- [Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)
- [Smart Contract Security and Auditing 101](https://youtu.be/0aJfCug1zTM)

#### Fuzz Testing and Static Analysis

Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a smart contract.

Static analysis is the analysis of smart contracts performed without executing them.

- [Getting Started with Smart Contract Fuzzing](https://www.immunebytes.com/blog/getting-started-with-smart-contract-fuzzing/)
- [Solidity smart contract Static Code Analysis](https://lightrains.com/blogs/solidity-static-analysis-tools/#static-code-analysis)
- [Smart contract Fuzzing](https://youtu.be/LRyyNzrqgOc)

#### Common Threat Vectors

Smart contract audits enable developers to provide a thorough analysis of smart contract sets. The main goal of a smart contract audit is to detect and eliminate vulnerabilities, starting with the most common threat vectors.

- [Smart Contract Attack Vectors](https://github.com/kadenzipfel/smart-contract-attack-vectors)
- [Solidity Security: Comprehensive list of known attack vectors and common anti-patterns](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html)
- [Blockchain Attack Vectors: Vulnerabilities of the Most Secure Technology](https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/578-blockchain-attack-vectors)

#### Source of Randomness Attacks

The security of cryptographic systems depends on some secret data that is known to authorized persons but unknown and unpredictable to others. To achieve this unpredictability, some randomization is typically employed. Modern cryptographic protocols often require frequent generation of random quantities. Cryptographic attacks that subvert or exploit weaknesses in this process are known as randomness attacks.

- [Smart Contract Randomness or ReplicatedLogic Attack](https://blog.finxter.com/randomness-or-replicatedlogic-attack-on-smart-contracts/)

### Tools

Blockchain and smart contract technology is faily new, therefore, you should expect constant changes in the security landscape, as new bugs and security risks are discovered, and new best practices are developed. Keeping track of this constantly moving landscape proves difficult, so using tools to aid this mission is important. The cost of failing to propertly secure smart contracts can be high, and because change can be difficult, we must make use of these tools.

#### Slither

Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details, and provides an API to easily write custom analyses. Slither enables developers to find vulnerabilities, enhance their code comprehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses.

- [Slither, the Solidity source analyzer](https://github.com/crytic/slither/blob/master/README.md)

- [Echidna: A Fast Smart Contract Fuzzer](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/blob/master/README.md)

## Management Platforms

Managing smart contracts in a production environment (mainnet) can prove difficult as users must keep track of different versions, blockchains, deployments, etc. Using a tool for this process eliminates a lot of the risk that comes with manual tracking.

### OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin Contracts helps you minimize risk by using battle-tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains. It includes the most used implementations of ERC standards.

- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/)

## Version Control Systems

Version control/source control systems allow developers to track and control changes to code over time. These services often include the ability to make atomic revisions to code, branch/fork off of specific points, and to compare versions of code. They are useful in determining the who, what, when, and why code changes were made.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)

## dApps - Decentralized Applications

A decentralised application (dApp) is an application that can operate autonomously, through the use of smart contracts that run on a blockchain. Like traditional applications, dApps provide some function or utility to its users.

- [Introduction to dApps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/)
- [What Is a Dapp? Decentralized Apps Explained](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-dapp-decentralized-apps-explained/)

### Frontend Frameworks

Web frameworks are designed to write web applications. Frameworks are collections of libraries that aid in the development of a software product or website. Frameworks for web application development are collections of various tools. Frameworks vary in their capabilities and functions, depending on the tasks set. They define the structure, establish the rules, and provide the development tools required.

- [Web3 Frontend – Everything You Need to Learn About Building Dapp Frontends](https://moralis.io/web3-frontend-everything-you-need-to-learn-about-building-dapp-frontends/)
- [What is the difference between a framework and a library?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_MO9vIRBcA)
- [Which JS Framework is best?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuHDQhDhvPE)

#### Vue.js

Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It is mainly focused on front end development.

- [Vue.js Website](https://vuejs.org/)

### Testing

A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

Like traditional software, testing dApps involves testing the entire stack that makes up the dApp (backend, frontend, db, etc.).

- [What is Software Testing?](https://www.guru99.com/software-testing-introduction-importance.html)
- [Testing Pyramid](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/testing-pyramid-for-test-automation)
- [How to test dApps (decentralized applications)](https://rhian-is.medium.com/how-to-test-dapps-decentralized-applications-4662cf61db90)

### Deployment

Deploying a dApp involves deployment of all of its layers, generally through a management framework.

- [Tutorial for building an Ethereum DApp with Integrated Web3 Monitoring](https://www.moesif.com/blog/blockchain/ethereum/Tutorial-for-building-Ethereum-Dapp-with-Integrated-Error-Monitoring/)

### Maintenance

dApps can be harder to maintain because the code and data published to the blockchain is harder to modify. It’s hard for developers to make updates to their dapps (or the underlying data stored by a dapp) once they are deployed, even if bugs or security risks are identified in an old version.

### Architecture

Unlike Web2 applications, in Web3 there’s no centralized database that stores the application state or user identity, and there’s no centralized web server where the backend logic resides.

- [The Architecture of a Web 3.0 application](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/the-architecture-of-a-web-3-0-application)
- [Decentralized Applications Architecture: Back End, Security and Design Patterns](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-design-a-secure-backend-for-your-decentralized-application-9541b5d8bddb/)

### Security

dApps face unique security challenges as they run on immutable blockchains. dApps are harder to maintain, and developers cannot modify or update their codes once deployed. Therefore, special consideration must be taken before putting it on the blockchain.

- [DAPP Security Standards](https://github.com/Dexaran/DAPP-security-standards/blob/master/README.md)
- [dApp Security Considerations](https://livebook.manning.com/book/building-ethereum-dapps/chapter-14/)
- [dApp Security:All You Need to Know](https://www.immunebytes.com/blog/dapp-security/#Benefits_of_DApps_Security)

### Applicability

dApps can be used for just about anything that requires two or more parties to agree on something. When the appropriate conditions are met, the smart contract will execute automatically. An important differentiation is that these transactions are no longer based on trust but they are rather based on cryptographically-backed smart contracts.

- [What is DeFi?](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-defi)

#### DAOs

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure. With no central governing body, every member within a DAO typically shares a common goal and attempt to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottoms-up management approach.

## Building for Scale

Due to the limited number of transactions-per-second (TPS) built-in to blockchains, a number of alternative mechanism and technologies have emerged to aid the scaling of blockchain dApps.

### State and Payment Channels

State channels refer to the process in which users transact with one another directly outside of the blockchain, or ‘off-chain,’ and greatly minimize their use of ‘on-chain’ operations.

- [The Basics of State Channels](https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/basics-state-channels/)
- [State Channels: An Introduction to Off-chain Transactions](https://www.talentica.com/blogs/state-channels-an-introduction-to-off-chain-transactions/)

### Optimistic Rollups and Fraud Proofs

‍Optimistic rollups are a layer 2 (L2) construction that improves throughput and latency on Ethereum’s base layer by moving computation and data storage off-chain. An optimistic rollup processes transactions outside of Ethereum Mainnet, reducing congestion on the base layer and improving scalability.

Optimistic rollups allow anyone to publish blocks without providing proofs of validity. However, to ensure the chain remains safe, optimistic rollups specify a time window during which anyone can dispute a state transition.

- [How Do Optimistic Rollups Work (The Complete Guide)](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/optimistic-rollups)

### Zero Knowledge Rollups and Zero Knowledge Proof

Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) are layer 2 scaling solutions that increase the throughput of a blockchain by moving computation and state-storage off-chain.

- [Zero-Knowledge Rollups - Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups)
- [What are Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-rollups)?](https://www.alchemy.com//blog/zero-knowledge-rollups)

### Validium

Validium is a scaling solution that enforces integrity of transactions using validity proofs like ZK-rollups, but doesn’t store transaction data on the Ethereum Mainnet. While off-chain data availability introduces trade-offs, it can lead to massive improvements in scalability

- [Validium - Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/)

### Sidechains

A sidechain is a separate blockchain network that connects to another blockchain – called a parent blockchain or mainnet – via a two-way peg.

- [Sidechains - Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/)
- [An Introduction to Sidechains](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/an-introduction-to-sidechains)

### Plasma

Plasma is a framework that allows the creation of child blockchains that use the main Ethereum chain as a layer of trust and arbitration. In Plasma, child chains can be designed to meet the requirements of specific use cases, specifically those that are not currently feasible on Ethereum.

- [Plasma Chains - Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/plasma/)

### Ethereum 2

Ethereum 2.0 marks a long-anticipated upgrade to the Ethereum public mainnet. Designed to accelerate Ethereum’s usage and adoption by improving its performance, Ethereum 2.0 implements Proof of Stake.

- [What Is Ethereum 2.0?](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-ethereum-2/)
- [What Is Ethereum 2.0? Understanding The Merge](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-2/)

### On-Chain Scaling

On-chain scaling refers to any direct modification made to a blockchain, like data sharding and execution sharding in the incoming version of Ethereum 2.0. Another type of on-chain scaling would be a sidechain with two-way bridge to Ethereum, like Polygon.

- [Scaling - Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/)
